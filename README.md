# ecommerce-db-system
This is an SQL database system that was created on Oracle. It represents an online store where customers can browse and purchase different products. This database stores data about users, products, and orders. The user can be a customer, a vendor, a customer service agent, or an admin. Customers can create an order by adding 1 or more products to the order then choosing a payment method. Customers can also have chat sessions with customer service agents to report a problem or ask for help with their order. Customer service agents can have access to customersâ€™ orders and edit them. Vendors can add or update their products along with their colors and sizes. Finally, admins can manage all the data that is in the system including users and products.
